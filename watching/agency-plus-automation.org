ML-infused interactive systems

A virtuous cycle:

Future challenges: First of all, ... figuring out how we get the correct
tooling in place to enable productive prototyping and much more rapid design
and deployment of these types of applications, I think is necessary to
accelerate our exploration of this space and so, in the process, learn what is
most effective, and this includes, I think, really rethinking the idea of user
interface toolkits into something where machine learning techniques are first
class citizens.

having a little bit of domain knowledge, ... with the right interaction
techniques, can still allow you to fairly quickly dial into views that will
allow you to improve your confidence in the data

I didn't set out to explore interactions between machine learning and user
interfaces. I was trying to solve a domain problem I thought was really
important and ... to do it well, with the right level of user effort, actually
required machine learning techniques to aid in the disambiguation of people's
input.
