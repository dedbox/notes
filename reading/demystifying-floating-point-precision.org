#+BEGIN_QUOTE

  What precision do I have at a number?

  When will I hit precision issues?

An IEEE 754 floating point number has 3 parts:

- sign
- exponent
- mantissa

Sign is always 1 bit.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

  The /exponent/ bits tell you which power of two numbers you are between
  
    [2^exponent, 2^{exponent+1})

  and the /mantissa/ tells you where you are in that range.

#+END_QUOTE

Additionally, all 1's in the exponent represents âˆž. All 0's means ???

#+LaTeX_HEADER: \DeclareMathOperator{\resolution}{resolution}

The /resolution/ of a floating point number is the smallest amount that can be
added or subtracted from it.

Let $f$ be a floating point number with sign $s$, exponent $e$, and mantissa
$m$, and denote by $\resolution(f)$ its resolution.

  \[ \resolution(f) = \frac{2^{e+1} - 2^e}{2^m} = 2^{e-m} \]

Numbers close to 1 have finer (i.e., lower) resolution than other numbers.

  \[ \resolution(f) \propto \frac{m}{e} \]

Fix $b$ the number of bits in $f$. Then $m = b - e - 1$ and

  \[ \frac{m}{e} = \frac{b-e-1}{e} = \frac{1+b-e-2}{e} = \frac{1}{e} + c \]

where $c=\frac{b-e-2}{e}$ a constant. Thus,

  \[ \resolution(f) \propto \frac{1}{e} \]
