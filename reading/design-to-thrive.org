The four elements necessary for long-term success:

- *R* emuneration
- *I* nfluence
- *B* elonging
- *S* ignificance

**** Remuneration

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[P]eople need to believe that they will obtain some positive return on the
investment of their time and energy in order to be attracted to participation
in a community. Individuals will not become members of a social network unless
there is a clear benefit for doing so.
#+END_QUOTE

**** Influence

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Essentially, influence means giving the members of the community a clear sense
that they have a voice in the community and control over how their voice will
be heard.
#+END_QUOTE

**** Belonging

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Successful communities have secret handshakes, special languages, icons,
colors, and symbols that (1) help members identify each other and (2)
cultivate that strong emotional attachment to others in the community, that
strong feeling of belonging.
#+END_QUOTE

**** Significance

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[I]n order for a community to be successful it has to be seen as significant.
It has to be respected.

    :END:

**** Social Networks

- Each user is the center of their own universe.
- May contain multiple overlapping groups.
- Secondary connections are weaker.
- Primary contact is harder.

**** Online Communities

- Relationships are "richer, more complex, and more predictable."
- Comprises a single group.
- Secondary connections are stronger.
- Primary contact is easier.
